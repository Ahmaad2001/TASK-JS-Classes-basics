/** Question 1: (1000 Points ⭐️)
 * 1. write a class of `Person`, give it the following properties
 * - firstName: String
 * - lastName: String
 * - gender: String
 * - birthYear: Number
 * - interests: [String]
 *
 * 2. Add the constructor that initializes all properties except the interests array should be empty by default
 *
 * 3. Add the following methods
 *
 *
 * + printName(), that print the persons full name  (first name and last name)
 * + calculateAge(currentYear), that takes a number of current year (i.e. 2021), and returns the age of the person
 * + addInterest(newInterest), that takes  a string of a new interest, and adds it to the interest array, and returns back the array
 *   after you are done with the class, create at least 3 objects of type Person of your interests

 * 2. Add the constructor that initializes all properties except the rating array should be empty by default
 *
 * 3. and the following the methods
 * + rate(rating),
 *      That adds a new rating to the rating array.
 *      Rating should be restricted to be greater than 0 and less than 10.
 *      This function will be used to make a single rating for the movie.
 * + averageRating(),
 *      That calculates the average of the rating array.
 *      if rating array includes the following data for example: [9, 9, 10, 10], then the averageRating should return 9.5 as an average
 *      the average equation: average = sumOfValues / countOfValues
 *      (*BONUS*): use the method reduce to calculate the average
